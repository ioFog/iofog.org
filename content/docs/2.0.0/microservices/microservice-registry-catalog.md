# Microservice Registry and Catalog Management

During the [Quickstart](../getting-started/quick-start-local.html) and the [tutorial](../tutorial/introduction.html), you specified images to be used for each microservice, for each type of Agent.

That was nice and easy, but what if you need to deploy the same code on a lot of Agents? You would need to specify the images for each Microservice. Wouldn't it be nice to have a way to specify the images to be used for each type of Agent once and then reuse this configuration? That's where the Controller Microservice catalog comes into play!

Each ioFog Controller comes with a built-in microservice catalog. You can see the list of preconfigured Microservices images using `iofogctl`:

```bash
iofogctl get catalog
```

```console
NAMESPACE
default

ID		NAME				            DESCRIPTION											                                            REGISTRY	X86					                ARM

```

Instead of specifying the images for each Agent type, you can refer to catalog ID in your Microservice specification. You can see that there is a `Hello Web Demo` catalog item that is configured with the `iofog/hello-web` image for x86 Agents, and `iofog/hello-web-arm` for ARM Agents. So, to deploy a Microservice running those images, you can use the following YAML:

```bash
echo "---
apiVersion: 'iofog.org/v2'
kind: Application
metadata:
        name: hello-web
spec:
---
apiVersion: 'iofog.org/v2'
kind: Microservice # Or application, as application uses the same spec for its microservices
metadata:
  name: hello-web
spec:
  agent:
    name: my-agent-name
    config: {}
  images:
    catalogId: 5
  container:
    env: []
    ports: []
    rootHostAccess: true
    volumes: []
    commands: []
  config: {}
  application: hello-web
  routes: []
" > /tmp/hello-web-catalog.yaml
iofogctl deploy microservice -f /tmp/hello-web-catalog.yaml
```

Note that this YAML snippet assumes you have an running ECN in the default Namespace with an Agent called `agent-name`.

You can check that the expected images have been used by describing your Microservice with iofogct:

```bash
iofogctl describe microservice 'hello-web'
```

```plain
apiVersion: iofog.org/v2
kind: Microservice
metadata:
  name: hello-web
  namespace: default
spec:
  uuid: KrbbKDg7bFdzFtBkBgZX8jDWnvFZbbZD
  name: hello-web
  agent:
    name: staging-caas-edgeworx-io-lkrcal023
    config:
      dockerUrl: unix:///var/run/docker.sock
      diskLimit: 50
      diskDirectory: /var/lib/iofog-agent/
      memoryLimit: 4096
      cpuLimit: 80
      logLimit: 10
      logDirectory: /var/log/iofog-agent/
      logFileCount: 10
      statusFrequency: 10
      changeFrequency: 10
      deviceScanFrequency: 60
      bluetoothEnabled: false
      watchdogEnabled: false
      abstractedHardwareEnabled: false
  images:
    catalogId: 5
    x86: iofog/hello-web
    arm: iofog/hello-web-arm
    registry: remote
  container:
    volumes: []
    env: []
    ports: []
    rootHostAccess: true
  config: {}
  application: hello-web

```

## Create your own Catalog Items

You can also use iofogctl to create your own Catalog Items. The YAML spec reference can be found [here](../iofogctl/catalogitem-yaml-spec.md).

```bash
$ echo "---
apiVersion: 'iofog.org/v2'
kind: CatalogItem
metadata:
  name: 'my-multiplatform-microservice'
spec:
  description: 'Alpine Linux'
  x86: 'amd64/alpine:latest'
  arm: 'arm32v6/alpine:latest'
  registry: 'remote'

" > /tmp/my-catalog-item.yaml
iofogctl deploy -f /tmp/my-catalog-item.yaml
```

You can verify that your new Catalog Item was added to the Catalog:

```bash
iofogctl get catalog | grep my-multiplatform-microservice
```

```plain
17		my-multiplatform-microservice	Alpine Linux											remote		amd64/alpine:latest			arm32v6/alpine:latest
```

You used grep to filter the ouput, but the columns are the same as above. You can now use the `spec.images.catalogId` field on `Microservice` kind set to 17 in order to deploy you microservice.
