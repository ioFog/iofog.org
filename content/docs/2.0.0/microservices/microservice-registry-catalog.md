# Registry and Catalog Management

During the [Quickstart](../getting-started/quick-start.html) and the [tutorial](../tutorial/introduction.html), we specified images to be used for each microservice, for each type of agent.

That was nice and easy, but what if you need to deploy the same code on a lot of agents? You'd need to specify the images for each microservice. Wouldn't it be nice to have a way to specify the images to be used for each type of agent once for all, then reuse this configuration ?

That's where the Controller microservice catalog comes into play!

Each ioFog Controller comes with a built-in microservice catalog. You can see the list of preconfigured microservices images using `iofogctl`:

```console
$ iofogctl get catalog

NAMESPACE
default

ID		NAME				            DESCRIPTION											                                            REGISTRY	X86					                ARM
4		Diagnostics			            0												                                                remote		iofog/diagnostics			        iofog/diagnostics-arm

```

Instead of specifying the images for each agent type, you can refer to catalog ID in your Microservice specification. We can see that there is a `Hello Web Demo` catalog item that is configured with the `iofog/hello-web` image for x86 agents, and `iofog/hello-web-arm` for arm agents. So, to deploy a microservice running those images, we can use the following yaml:

```console
$ echo "---
apiVersion: 'iofog.org/v2'
kind: Application
metadata:
        name: hello-web
spec:
---
apiVersion: 'iofog.org/v2'
kind: Microservice # Or application, as application uses the same spec for its microservices
metadata:
  name: hello-web
spec:
  agent:
    name: my-agent-name
    config: {}
  images:
    catalogId: 5
  container:
    env: []
    ports: []
    rootHostAccess: true
    volumes: []
    commands: []
  config: {}
  application: hello-web
  routes: []
" > ./hello-web-catalog.yaml

$ iofogctl deploy microservice -f ./hello-web-catalog.yaml
```

Note that this YAML snippet assumes you have an iofogctl stack running, with an agent called `agent-name`. Please replace Agent name accordingly. Once done, we can check that the expected images have been used by using iofogctl to describe our newly created microservice:

```console
$ iofogctl describe microservice 'hello-web'

apiVersion: iofog.org/v2
kind: Microservice
metadata:
  name: hello-web
  namespace: default
spec:
  uuid: KrbbKDg7bFdzFtBkBgZX8jDWnvFZbbZD
  name: hello-web
  agent:
    name: staging-caas-edgeworx-io-lkrcal023
    config:
      dockerUrl: unix:///var/run/docker.sock
      diskLimit: 50
      diskDirectory: /var/lib/iofog-agent/
      memoryLimit: 4096
      cpuLimit: 80
      logLimit: 10
      logDirectory: /var/log/iofog-agent/
      logFileCount: 10
      statusFrequency: 10
      changeFrequency: 10
      deviceScanFrequency: 60
      bluetoothEnabled: false
      watchdogEnabled: false
      abstractedHardwareEnabled: false
  images:
    catalogId: 5
    x86: iofog/hello-web
    arm: iofog/hello-web-arm
    registry: remote
  container:
    volumes: []
    env: []
    ports: []
    rootHostAccess: true
  config: {}
  application: hello-web

```

## Create your own catalog items

You can also use iofogctl to create your own catalog items. Please see the [iofogctl YAML documentation](../iofogctl/catalogitem-yaml-spec.md) for comprehensive specification of the YAML kinds.

```console
$ echo "---
apiVersion: 'iofog.org/v2'
kind: CatalogItem
metadata:
  name: 'my-multiplatform-microservice'
spec:
  description: 'Alpine Linux'
  x86: 'amd64/alpine:latest'
  arm: 'arm32v6/alpine:latest'
  registry: 'remote'

" > ./my-catalog-item.yaml

$ iofogctl deploy -f ./my-catalog-item.yaml
```

We can verify that our new catalog item was added to the catalog:

```console
$ iofogctl get catalog | grep my-multiplatform-microservice

17		my-multiplatform-microservice	Alpine Linux											remote		amd64/alpine:latest			arm32v6/alpine:latest
```

We used grep to filter the ouput, but the columns are the same as above. You can now use the `spec.images.catalogId` field on `Microservice` kind set to 17 in order to deploy you microservice.
