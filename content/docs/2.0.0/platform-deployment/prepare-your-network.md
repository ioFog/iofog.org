# Prepare Your Network

Once you have a set of remote hosts (and/or a Kubernetes cluster) you need to make sure that you have appropriate firewall rules for the ioFog components that you will start deploying on those remote hosts.

The following is an exhaustive list of the ingress firewall rules required for any ioFog Edge Compute Network.

| Component  | Protocol/Port | Description                                             |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Controller | tcp:51121, 80 | Controller API and ECN Viewer.                          |
| iofogctl   | tcp:22        | SSH access to install ioFog components on remote hosts. |
