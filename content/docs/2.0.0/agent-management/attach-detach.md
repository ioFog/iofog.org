# Attach / Detach an Agent

You can transfer an Agent from one ECN to another by detaching the agent and attaching it to another ECN.
Note: detaching an agent will delete its connection with the Controller, and all microservices will be shut down.

```bash
iofogctl detach agent AGENT_NAME
```

Switch to another ECN / namespace

```bash
iofogctl attach agent AGENT_NAME
```

To display all resources in dettached state with the get command

```bash
iofogctl get all --detached
```

If you have an Agent ready and running on a remote host, you can also attach it directly using host and ssh credentials:

```bash
iofogctl attach agent NAME --host HOST --host AGENT_HOST --user SSH_USER --port SSH_PORT --key SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH
```
