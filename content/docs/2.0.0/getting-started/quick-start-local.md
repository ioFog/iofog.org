# Quick Start

In this guide we will:

- Install the prerequisites and tools required to create and manage Edge Compute Networks ('ECNs')
- Create an ECN on a local machine to demonstrate the processes and components involved in an ECN
- Deploy a set of Microservices on our local ECN

## Prerequisites

- `Docker 1.10+`: Open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. ([installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/))

#### Install iofogctl on Mac

Mac users can use Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap eclipse-iofog/iofogctl
brew install iofogctl@2.0
```

#### Install iofogctl on Windows

The Windows binary can be downloaded from https://storage.googleapis.com/iofogctl/win/2.0/iofogctl.exe.

##### Prepare Windows

In order to use `iofogctl` to deploy an ECN locally on Windows we will need to configure Docker to run Linux containers:

- Install [docker desktop for windows](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe)
- Enable Hyper-V in Powershell `Install-WindowsFeature -Name Hyper-V -IncludeManagementTools -Restart`
- Ensure that docker is running with [Linux containers mode](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers)

#### Install iofogctl on Linux

The Debian package can be installed like so:

```bash
curl https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/iofog/iofogctl/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get install iofogctl
```

And similarly, the RPM package can be installed like so:

```bash
curl https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/iofog/iofogctl/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
sudo yum install iofogctl
```

#### Verify iofogctl Installation

Run `iofogctl version` to verify you have successfully installed the CLI.

## Deploy ioFog Locally

You can use `iofogctl deploy` to install and provision ECN components. Here we will deploy a containerized ECN locally.

  <p>We aren't going into detail about iofogctl here because we want to show you how simple it can be to get going with ioFog. Please make sure to check out the full iofogctl documentation <a href="../iofogctl/usage.html">here</a>.</p>
</aside>

Go ahead and paste the following commands into your terminal:

```bash
echo "---
apiVersion: iofog.org/v2
kind: LocalControlPlane
metadata:
  name: ecn
spec:
  iofogUser:
    name: Quick
    surname: Start
    email: user@domain.com
    password: q1u45ic9kst563art
  controller:
    name: local
    container:
      image: iofog/controller:2.0.0-beta
---
apiVersion: iofog.org/v2
kind: LocalAgent
metadata:
  name: local
spec:
  container:
    image: iofog/agent:2.0.0-beta
" > /tmp/quick-start.yaml
iofogctl deploy -f /tmp/quick-start.yaml
```

After the deployment has successfully completed, we can verify the resources we specified in the YAML file are running on our local machine.

```bash
iofogctl get all
```

Which should output something similar to:

```plain
NAMESPACE
default

CONTROLLER    STATUS    AGE               UPTIME         ADDR             PORT

AGENT         STATUS    AGE               UPTIME         ADDR             VERSION
local         RUNNING   2h26m             1h15m          150.107.172.240  2.0.0-beta

APPLICATION	  STATUS    MICROSERVICES

MICROSERVICE  STATUS    AGENT             CONFIG         ROUTES           VOLUMES      PORTS

VOLUME        SOURCE    DESTIONATION      PERMISSIONS    AGENTS
```

**NB:** The Agent status might say `UNKNOWN` for up to 30s. It is the time for the agent to report back its liveness to the controller.

The `Controller` acts as a control plane, it will be your main point of access and communication with your ECN. If you want to find out more about Controller, please read <a href="../controllers/overview.html">this</a>.

The `Agent` is the component that is meant to run on your edge devices. Once it has registered itself with a Controller, the Agent will be in charge of actually pulling the microservices images and starting / stopping the microservices on your edge device. If you want to find out more about Agent, please read <a href="../agents/overview.html">this</a>.

Those components are all currently running as separate Docker containers on your local machine. You can list the active containers by running:

```bash
docker ps
```

Which should output something similar to:

```plain
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                                          COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                            NAMES

```

## Deploy Microservices

Now that our local ECN is up, lets put it to use. The following commands will deploy a demonstration application on your ECN:

```bash
echo "---
apiVersion: iofog.org/v2
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: HealthcareWearable
spec:
  microservices:
  - name: heart-rate-monitor
    agent:
      name: local-agent
      config:
        bluetoothEnabled: false # this will install the iofog/restblue microservice
        abstractedHardwareEnabled: false
    images:
      arm: edgeworx/healthcare-heart-rate:arm-v1
      x86: edgeworx/healthcare-heart-rate:x86-v1
      registry: remote # public docker
    container:
      rootHostAccess: false
      volumes:
        - hostDestination: /tmp/msvc
          containerDestination: /tmp
          accessMode: z
      ports: []
    config:
      test_mode: true
      data_label: 'Anonymous_Person'
  # Simple JSON viewer for the heart rate output
  - name: heart-rate-viewer
    agent:
      name: local-agent
    images:
      arm: edgeworx/healthcare-heart-rate-ui:arm
      x86: edgeworx/healthcare-heart-rate-ui:x86
      registry: remote
    container:
      rootHostAccess: false
      ports:
        # The ui will be listening on port 80 (internal).
        - external: 5000
          internal: 80
          public: 5000
      volumes:
      - hostDestination: /tmp/iofog
        containerDestination: /data
        accessMode: rw
      env:
        - key: BASE_URL
          value: http://localhost:8080/data
  routes:
  # Use this section to configure route between microservices
  # Use microservice name
  - from: heart-rate-monitor
    to: heart-rate-viewer" > /tmp/quick-start-app.yaml
iofogctl deploy -f /tmp/quick-start-app.yaml
```

This deploys two microservices: `heart-rate-monitor` and `heart-rate-viewer`. The former generates mock heart rate data that would normally be generated with a physical heart monitoring device, and the latter is a web application that offers a live visualisation of the generated data.

After `iofogctl deploy -f /tmp/quick-start-app.yaml` has completed, the agent will have to download each microservice image and start them.

You can follow the progress by running the command:

```bash
watch iofogctl get microservices
```

Which will output something similar to:

```plain
Every 2.0s: iofogctl get microservices                                                                                                                                                       Nehas-MacBook-Pro.local: Mon Mar 16 20:27:38 2020

MICROSERVICE            STATUS          AGENT           CONFIG                                                  ROUTES                  VOLUMES         PORTS
heart-rate-monitor      QUEUED          local-agent     {"data_label":"Anonymous_Person","test_mode":true}      heart-rate-viewer       /tmp/msvc:/tmp
heart-rate-viewer       QUEUED          local-agent     {}                                                                              /tmp/iofog:/data5000:80
```

Once both microservice status are 'RUNNING', the microservices have started. You will be able to see the web application on your browser at <a href="http://localhost:5000/" target="_blank">http://localhost:5000</a>.

## Teardown

To remove our ECN and any microservices deployed on it, we can run the following command:

```bash
iofogctl delete all
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have seen what ioFog is about, you can create a real ECN with remote hosts. Instructions are found [here](content/docs/2.0.0/platform-deployment/introduction.html).

You can also try deploying other Microservices on the local ECN. You can find instructions on writing your own Microservice [here](../writing-microservices/overview.html) and a step-by-step [tutorial](../tutorial/introduction.html).
