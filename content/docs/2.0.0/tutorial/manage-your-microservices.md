# Manage Your Microservices

In this step of the tutorial you're ready to learn the basics of managing microservices inside our [Tutorial project](../tutorial/introduction.html).

## Basic Controller CLI Interactions

The Agent daemon runs microservices on your edge nodes locally, but it is controlled remotely by the Controller. Let's learn some of the most common Controller commands.

This tutorial includes 3 microservices already running. You can view any configured microservices using `iofogctl`:

```console
iofogctl get microservices

MICROSERVICE	STATUS		AGENT		CONFIG		ROUTES		VOLUMES		PORTS
Sensors		    RUNNING		local-agent	{}		    Rest API
Rest API	    RUNNING		local-agent	{}						            10101:80
Freeboard	    RUNNING		local-agent	{}						            10102:80


```

This returns a list of microservices along with their status, the agent it is running on, configuration, routes, volume mapping and port mapping.

The tutorial consists of 3 microservices deployed on top of ioFog stack.

The _Sensors_ microservice pretends to be reading data from a local hardware sensor. The data it produces is published with [the SDK](../developing-microservices/sdk.html) and routed through an AQMP Dispatch Router to the REST API microservice, so that it can be read by other microservices that only understand REST API.

[Sensors microservice source code on Github](https://github.com/ioFog/example-microservices/tree/master/sensors-data)

The _REST API_ is a generic microservice that provides a REST API web server, allowing access to any arbitrary data source connected using the Controller.

_Freeboard_ is the last microservice that provides an HTML dashboard to view the real-time results coming from a rest API data source. In the case of our tutorial, the source of the data is our REST API microservice.

Currently, loading the [freeboard dashboard](http://localhost:10102/?load=dashboard.json) should look similar to this:

## Routes

The Sensors and REST API microservices are generic. They are not hardcoded to talk with each other, instead, the relationship dictating the flow of data was configured through the Controller. This is in the spirit of the microservice architecture, separating concerns into pieces so that you can combine and interchange them.

To connect microservices together, the Controller has the concept of routes.

Routes can be listed from the `iofogctl get microservices` or `iofogctl describe microservice <name>` commands. You can see that a route has already been set up for us: the Sensors microservice has its destination (output) directed to the REST API microservice.

```console
$ iofogctl describe microservice Sensors

apiVersion: iofog.org/v2
kind: Microservice
metadata:
  name: Sensors
  namespace: default
spec:
  uuid: cHttwNHmDnj2rYcX6qypgcr9JDpV2CNR
  name: Sensors
  agent:
    name: local-agent
    config:
      dockerUrl: unix:///var/run/docker.sock
      diskLimit: 50
      diskDirectory: /var/lib/iofog-agent/
      memoryLimit: 1024
      cpuLimit: 80
      logLimit: 10
      logDirectory: /var/log/iofog-agent/
      logFileCount: 10
      statusFrequency: 30
      changeFrequency: 60
      deviceScanFrequency: 60
      bluetoothEnabled: false
      watchdogEnabled: false
      abstractedHardwareEnabled: false
  images:
    catalogId: 0
    x86: iofog/sensors:latest
    arm: ""
    registry: remote
  config: {}
  rootHostAccess: false
  ports: []
  volumes: []
  env: []
  routes:
  - Rest API
  application: tutorial
```

You'll discover later on how to create and remove routes using iofogctl.

## Create Your First Microservice

Next up, you're going to create your very first microservice to run on ioFog.
