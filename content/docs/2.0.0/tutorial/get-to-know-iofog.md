# Get To Know ioFog

In this step of the tutorial you'll better familiarize ourselves with the ioFog environment [you just set up](introduction.html) in the previous step and `iofogctl`.

## Check Your Environment

You can have a comprehensive view of your Edge Cloud Network (ECN) and the running docker containers by using the `./status.sh` shell script.

```bash
$ ./status.sh
```

Or you can manually verify that the ioFog stack containers are correctly started. Note that it may take a minute or two for ioFog to start the tutorial microservices. The output should look like the following.

```console
$ iofogctl get all

NAMESPACE
default

CONTROLLER	      STATUS		AGE		    UPTIME		IP		    PORT
local-controller  online		1h4m		1h4m		0.0.0.0		51121

```

```console
$ docker ps --filter "name=iofog"

```

You can also see that in the PORTS column some of these containers have published [port mappings](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/container-networking/):

For example, there's a microservice running an instance of [Freeboard](https://github.com/Freeboard/freeboard), an open source visualization dashboard for IoT devices. It's running a web server that serves the dashboard.

Wait for the microservices to be in a `RUNNING` state. It may take a few minutes as the images need to be pulled.

```bash
watch iofogctl get microservices
```

Go ahead and try the web app out at http://localhost:10102/?load=dashboard.json

The Freeboard microservice doesn't know it's running locally, so it could just as well be running on real edge node hardware!

## ioFog Containers

Our tutorial environment has two ioFog containers:

- [Agents](../reference-agent/overview.html)
- [Controllers](../reference-controller/overview.html)

You can think of each of these containers as if they were deployed on separate devices. In production, your Controller is most often running on a cloud server and your Agents are each running on individual edge devices in the field. The Controller is controlling the Agent the same way it would if the devices were hundreds of miles away.

### iofogctl vs component CLIs

We are currently in the process of migrating all your management system into one tool to rule them all: `iofogctl` !

However, this process is still ongoing and even though you can do everything you need for this tutorial (and much more...) in iofogctl, you must know that every ioFog component (Agent and Controller) has its local CLI (iofog-agent, iofog-controller) that can prove itself useful.

In the following sections you will us `iofogctl legacy ...` commands to use the older component CLIs. Note that, because you have a local ECN, you could also use `docker exec` instead.

#### Agent's Container

Let's start by using `iofogctl` to retrieve a detailed description of your Agent.

```console
$ iofogctl describe agent local-agent
apiVersion: iofog.org/v2
kind: AgentConfig
metadata:
  name: local-agent
  namespace: default
spec:
  uuid: 62GHyYgrGrfbYfhxwk9Q8LQW34VVMtKq
  name: local-agent
  location: ""
  latitude: -36.8486
  longitude: 174.754
  description: ""
  dockerUrl: unix:///var/run/docker.sock
  diskLimit: 50
  diskDirectory: /var/lib/iofog-agent/
...
```

Let's see how you can use the legacy `iofog-agent` CLI to find out its status.

```console
$ iofogctl legacy agent local-agent status

ioFog daemon                : RUNNING
Memory Usage                : about 248.96 MiB
Disk Usage                  : about 17.91 MiB
CPU Usage                   : about 3.38 %

System Available Memory     : 763.71 MB
System Total CPU            : 0.28 %
```

There's also the legacy `info` command, used to view this Agent's settings:

```console
$ iofogctl legacy agent local-agent info

Iofog UUID                               : 62GHyYgrGrfbYfhxwk9Q8LQW34VVMtKq

#### Controller's Container

Let's list all the configured ioFog nodes using `iofogctl`.

```console
$ iofogctl get agents

NAMESPACE
default

AGENT		STATUS		AGE		    UPTIME		IP		        VERSION
local-agent	RUNNING		1h26m		1h25m		91.178.63.198	1.3.0


```

Now, let's try listing all the preconfigured ioFog nodes using the Controller CLI.

```console
$ iofogctl legacy controller local-controller iofog list
{
  "fogs": [
    {
      "lastActive": 1568371373399,
      "daemonOperatingDuration": 5312950,
      "daemonLastStart": 1568366050335,
      "systemAvailableDisk": 46123114496,
      "systemAvailableMemory": 890736640,
      "repositoryCount": 2,
      "systemTime": 1568371324278,
      "lastStatusTime": 1568371365808,
      "processedMessages": 149610,
      "messageSpeed": 86,
      "lastCommandTime": 0,
      "logFileCount": 10,
      "uuid": "62GHyYgrGrfbYfhxwk9Q8LQW34VVMtKq",
      "name": "local-agent",
...
```

This should give us a JSON response containing a list of edge nodes already registered with the Controller. In your case you should get a single node, `"name": "local-agent"`. This "node" is the container environment of iofog-agent. Remember that in production, instead of being containers running locally on your machine, these nodes would be real edge hardware as part of your Edge Compute Network (ECN), where your microservices run.

## Manage Your Microservices

Now that you know your way around a bit, let's learn how to manage and launch microservices!
